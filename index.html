				<p>Marie Curie was a polish-french physicist and chemist who was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher.As a child,she received a general education in local schools and some scientific training from her father.Then she studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw.In age 24 she went to paris to study, where she conducted pioneering research on radioactivity and her scientific work.There she met and married the French physicist Pierre Curie. With him and the physicist Henri Becquerel she shared her first Nobel price in Physics in 1903 for their work on radioactivity. Later when her husband died, Marie won another Nobel Price on Chemistry,for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium .She was the first woman to win a Nobel price twice and the only one to win it in two scientific fields.She died in 1934,at age 66 from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I. Marie Curie was an incredible woman, physicist and chemist who proved that women can be equally succesful as men. She should be a rolemodel to many young girls and a perfect insparation for them to achieve their goals. </p>

				<p class-duo>Radioactivity is the property of some unstable atoms (radionuclides) to spontaneously emit nuclear radiation, usually alpha particles or beta particles often accompanied by gamma-rays. This radiation is emitted when the nucleus undergoes radioactive decay and is converted into a different isotope which may, according to its number of neutrons and protons, be either radioactive (unstable) or non-radioactive (stable). This “daughter” nucleus will usually be of a different chemical element to the original isotope.Atoms found in nature are either stable or unstable. An atom is stable if the forces among the particles that makeup the nucleus are balanced. An atom is unstable (radioactive) if these forces are unbalanced; if the nucleus has an excess of internal energy. Instability of an atom's nucleus may result from an excess of either neutrons or protons. A radioactive atom will attempt to reach stability by ejecting nucleons (protons or neutrons), as well as other particles, or by releasing energy in other forms.</p>
